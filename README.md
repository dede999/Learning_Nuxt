# Learning Nuxt JS

> My sublime Nuxt.js project

Learning Nuxt on my spare time, trough Vue school course. 
Probably gonna need some help.

## Build Setup

``` shell
# install dependencies
$ yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org).
